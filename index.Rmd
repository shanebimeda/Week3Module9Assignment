## R Markdown Presentation and Plotly  

#### This is my *submission* to the **peer-graded assignment for Week 3** of the **Developing Data Products Module**   

#### For this, I have loaded the **mtcars** dataset from the **datasets** package and used the **plotly** package to generate the plot. 

## Plot of Miles per Gallon (mpg) and Displacement (disp) and Cylinder (4, 6, and 8)

```{r, comment= FALSE, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(plotly)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = ~disp, 
        y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl),
        size = ~hp)
```  

##                 Thank you!     :)
